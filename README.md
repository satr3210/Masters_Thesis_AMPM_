# Assesing the Impacts of Immersive, Adaptive Virtual Reality Training for Entry, Descent, and Landing Tasks on Long Duration Exploration Missions 
## Sandra Tredinnick 
My work assesses the impact of immersive, adaptive virtual reality training for entry, descent, and landing tasks on long duration exploration missions. Kruskal-Wallis, Mixed-ANOVA, and non-linear multilevel modeling was utilized to assess the training and testing data. This work is funded by NASA.
